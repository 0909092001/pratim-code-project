🔍 Project Title:
Vendor Sales & Inventory Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI + Python)

🧭 Project Overview
This end-to-end data analytics and visualization project is built to address a key business challenge in supply chain and vendor management — tracking sales performance, purchase efficiency, and inventory optimization for wine and beverage vendors.

The solution integrates multiple real datasets such as vendor invoices, purchase prices, beginning and ending inventories, and generates a unified vendor sales summary analyzed using Python (Pandas, SQL, ML) and Power BI visual dashboards.

The primary goal is to help the business identify:

Top-performing vendors and brands

Cost-saving opportunities from bulk purchases

Low-turnover inventory issues

Contribution of each vendor toward total sales and profit

Purchasing versus sales efficiency and operational bottlenecks
💡 Business Problem Solved
Enterprise beverage distributors deal with massive inventory and thousands of vendor relationships. Delayed visibility into purchase costs, price margins, and vendor contribution reduces profitability.

This project builds a centralized analytical layer that answers:

Which vendor contributes most to total sales and profit?

How do purchase prices vary during bulk orders?

Which brands have high margins but low sales traction?

Where do we hold excess or inefficient inventory worth millions?

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end data analytics workflow to evaluate vendor performance using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Business Problem
Organizations work with multiple vendors, but inconsistent performance can impact cost, delivery, and profitability. This project analyzes vendor data to identify performance gaps and improvement opportunities.

## Tech Stack
- SQL – Data cleaning and transformations
- Python – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Power BI – Dashboards and KPIs
- PDF – Business reporting

## Project Workflow
1. Data ingestion and cleaning using SQL
2. Exploratory analysis using Python
3. Dashboard creation in Power BI
4. Business reporting and recommendations

## Key Metrics
- Total Sales by Vendor
- Profit Margin Percentage
- Inventory Turnover
- Vendor Contribution Analysis

## Outcome
The analysis helps decision‑makers:
- Identify top and weak vendors
- Optimize procurement strategies
- Improve vendor negotiations
